/**
 * Primitive or simple data types are fundamental to programming
 * in JavaScript, and are stored in the memory as single values. Examples of
 * primitive data types in JavaScript include:
 * 
 * 
 * Number - Represents any numerical value, including integers and floats.
 * 
 * String - Represents a sequence of characters.
 * 
 * Boolean - Represents either true or false.
 * 
 * undefined - Represents a value that has not been defined yet.
 * 
 * null - Represents the absence of any data.
 * 
 * 
 * Complex or composite data types are made up of one or more
 * primitive data types and are used to represent more complex entities. Examples of
 * complex data types in JavaScript include:
 * 
 * Array - A collection of values of any type, typically ordered and indexed.
 * 
 * Object - A collection of key-value pairs, where the keys and values can be of any data type.
 * 
 * Function - Used to define and execute a block of code.
 * 
 * 
 * It's important to note that in JavaScript, all data types are passed by
 * reference, meaning that if you pass an object or an array as an argument to a
 * function, any changes made to that object or array within the function will
 * reflect in the original object or array outside the function as well. This can be
 * useful in some cases, but can also lead to unexpected behaviors if not understood
 * properly.
